							<p>For someone who likes to talk about fiction as passionately as I do, it is odd that I have not read that many books. I can name. quite a few reasons for that, from not having the patience or interest for them, to other hobbies and interests, the abundance of choices, and most prominent is the many books I was forced to read in school, I’m sorry, I just don’t like Shakespeare, and having to read him every year certainly didn’t help.</p>
							<p>I remember how my mother and father would read books to me as a kid, my mother more to my memory, but still the both of them. Apparently, my father used to read me the children’s story Paul Bunyan, which I still own and is in my room to this day (although I’m pretty sure I stole it from the library, but keep that to yourself). I remember how my mother used to read the Harry Potter books to me and my older brother before bed, and I actually knew the story for the last few movies before they came out, and I remember reading them myself for the first time. That was a big part of the motivation for reading books, but not just Harry Potter, there was also Game of Thrones. </p>
							<p>I started reading all the books after I was disappointed in the way the show ended, and at the same time at the recommendation of the author through his blog, I found a new favourite, The Last Kingdom. During the COVID lockdown I fell in love with this show, and while waiting for the next season, I picked up the books, and the author Bernard Cornwell, is a new favourite of mine. When I started reading more, I started watching videos about YouTubers recommending books, specifically fantasy books, and since them I have actively been reading and more interested in reading books. I can also not understate the influence that reading Manga and comics had on how much I read, which lead to my interest in reading more.</p>
                            <p>The reviews below are just quick reviews of what I thought about the books or book series. I eventually hope to make more longform reviews and analyses of these stories, probably in the form of YouTube videos.</p>
