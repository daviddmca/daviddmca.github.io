							<h style="font-size: 18px"><b>About Me</b></h>
                                <p>My name is David Darius McArthur, a fifth year University student in the English & Professional Writing Program at York University. I was born and raised in Toronto, snd still live here to this day.</p>
                                <p>I have a great love for writing and reading, sports, animals, and much more. I love stories, and of any kind, whether it be fiction, non-fiction, history, etc. My writing expreience is in the academic and ameteur sense, with the wish to venture into the professional sense, as a soon to be graduate.</p>
                                <p>While I do like to share content, I do not like to share much about myself, I would like to keep my personal life personal, so certain information about me may be redacted, and may only be avialable to you if you wish to speak with me further. If you simply wish to scroll, please feel free, and if you wish, please leave a comment, as seen at the bottom.</p>
                                <style>
                             h
                                {
                                     line-height: 70px
                                }
                                </style>
                            <h style="font-size: 18px"><b>As a Writer</b></h>
                                <p>As a writer I have a great love and want for writing about fiction, from writing my own stories and the many works in progresses that is, as well as writing reviews of pieces of fiction, especially the ones that mean something to me. I also want to write deep dives into what makes certain pieces of fiction a favourite of mine, and how it shaped me as a person and my personal taste in stories.</p>
<p>Along with fiction, another great love of mine is sports, and I would like to incorporate that into my writing in some kind of way. This could include things like speaking about why I like certain sports, or athletes, or certain moments in sports history that I personally love and why sports are something I love.</p>
<p>I have written reviews for websites, but they are very brief and lack the depth I would like them to have. If I could do reviews, I would actually like to try them in the video format, which I would add to the website as they are made.</p>
<p>When it comes to what I value in my writing and others writing is an emotional connection to the writing. You should care in some kind of way about what you are writing about, whether it is about a hobby, yourself, or any other kind of things, if you care about what you are writing, there is more of a chance that someone else will care.</p>

                                <p>I have a great passion for writing, especially when it comes to forms of entertainment, like books, movies, comics, sports, and reviewing and analizing them is what I wish to do the most. As I gain more skills, I will push myself to share my writing, over many platforms and in many forms.</p>
