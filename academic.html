							<h1>Academic Writing</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/desk.jpg" alt="Office Desk" /></span>
							<p>As I am a current student, majority of the writing that I have done the past few years, and most of my life really, has been academic. The range of what I have to write about and the style and format I write is different. There are samples of writing below, with a brief description for the writing pieces, for example the context behind the assignment, why I went about writing it the way I did. Note that the writing pieces can range in quality based on when I wrote it, or how much time was put into it.</p>
							<p>While I do call it writing, it is not exclusively prose-writing. There may be a video, or writing that includes images, etc.</p>
                            <h3><a href="writing/cproject.pdf"><b>Creative Writing Project</b></a></h3>
                            <p>In this assignment, the objective was to make a creative piece, my project being a collection of stories that go over people who are terminally ill, and how they spend the little time they have left. The story goes over themes of reconnection, acceptance, joy, and reflection.</p>
                            <h3><a href="writing/critprecis.pdf"><b>Critical Precis</b></a></h3>
                            <p>A critical analysis of one of the readings done for a course, this one being the graphic novel, Louis Riel. This analysis goes over the genre, medium, narrative structure and voice, and the significance of the beginning and ending.</p>
                            <h3><a href="writing/ressay.pdf"><b>Research Essay</b></a></h3>
                            <p>This essay shows Indigenous medicine used in Australia for cancer treatment, and where it was most commonly used in the country, the effectiveness, and who uses it.</p>
