							<h1>Sports Teams and Athletes</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Since I love sports and the moments that made me love them, there are also the teams and athletes that I love. I mentioned in the Sports Moments page how I fell in love with Hockey through Sidney Crosby’s “Golden Goal” and he has been one of my two favourites since, but he is an individual. When you are cheering for a single athlete, there are probably many positive reasons why, they are incredibly good at the sport, they play it the right way, or with good sportsmanship, maybe what they do outside of the sport, but there are teams or organizations that you cheer for, and that is different.</p>
<p>There is a certain amount of pain that comes with cheering for a team. With a singular athlete, so long as they play well, then you have something to be happy about, and more than likely your favourite athlete will win some kind of an award, but it can be pretty heartbreaking to see them not win, so what does that feel like for an entire team. I will be very up front, my favourite team for my favourite sport has really given me nothing but misery. I love hockey, it my favourite sport, to watch, to play, just in general, but I cheer for my hometown team, the Toronto Maple Leaf’s.</p>
<p>When I started watching hockey, this team was terrible, but I only had one channel, so it was not like I could watch any other team. I was not an optimist when it came to this team, mostly because of my father, but I don’t really blame him, he is not really a sports fan, but he knows the Leaf’s, and the last time they won the Stanley Cup, he was 12, and it has been over 50 years since then, but despite the heartbreak and disappointment, I still love this team and there are many other teams across different sports that I love. There will be articles of certain athletes and teams that I love, and my history with them as a fan.</p>
