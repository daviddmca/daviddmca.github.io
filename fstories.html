							<h1>Formulative Stories</h1>

							<p>I came up with this concept not that long ago when thinking about a possible series of writings for the possible YouTube account I would start. A series of videos, or in this case scripts, going over stories that had a big impact on me, the main focus being on how they influenced me. This includes how they influenced my taste in stories, genres, the lessons I learned, and how much they personally mean to me.</p>
                            <p>This concept was meant to spotlight stories regardless of their medium or purpose. For example, this could be a movie, live-action or animated, a television series, or in some cases a game, a video-game, card-game, etc., the stories are meant to be over many different mediums and genres. This is not meant to be an analysis of the quality of the story, like how well written the plot or characters are, but to go over the way it influence and changed the individual, in this case myself.</p>
							<p>This may be a concept that you resonate with, and if you do, just start writing. Maybe you want to start a blog writing about fiction or non-fiction and the stories that had a big impact and influence on you. This concept of a series of writings is something I came up with myself, but I am sure there are people who had a similar set of writing pieces.</p>
                             <p>The hope for these pieces, is to use them as a base, for what would be a more in-depth review of these stories, done in the form of either an essay or a video.</p>
