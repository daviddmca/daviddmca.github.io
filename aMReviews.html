							<h1>Anime and Manga Reviews</h1>

							<p>When I was a kid, I would a lot of animated stories, movies and series, and some of these animated stories happened to be originally made in Japan. Things like Pok√©mon, Spirited Away, were stories that I did not know were Anime, but when I started watching other shows with my older brother and my best friend, around the time I was six, I knew what I had been watching was anime. Series like Naruto, Dragon Ball Z, and many more. Ever since then I have been watching, I even remember how I kept the fact that I watched them to myself, since it was in a way frowned upon to like it then, now I see how it is kind of cool.</p>
							<p>I started reading manga after watching the show Attack on Titan, because of how I could not wait for the next season, and had to know what happened. Since then, I have become more of a manga fan then an anime fan, even starting to buy physical copies of some of my favourite series, which if you know anything about buying them, you know it is not cheap.
I do not have a particular genre I prefer when it come to these mediums, which is odd, considering that I love fantasy and historical fiction, and even though my two favourite series, Berserk and Vagabond, are those two respective genres, I also like other series that are not those genres at all, like Monster, a mystery-thriller, or Goodnight Punpun, which is just a slice-of life series, although be warned, it gets brutally real about life, and may cause more trauma than any other series. I think of all the mediums of story, this is the one where I do not think about the genre when it comes to the story at all.
</p>
							<p>This is the medium that got me the most dedicated to talking about stories, and created inspiration for me to write myself and create my own stories.</p>
